                This policy covers the use of our website and our other systems
                that process personally identifiable information. It is not
                exhaustive as there are processes such as the processing of DBS

            <p>
                When someone visits our website by clicking on a google search

                behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the

                information is only processed in a way which does not identify
                anyone individually. We do not make, and do not allow Google to
                make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting
                our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable
                information through our website, we will be up front about this.
                We will make it clear when we collect personal information and

            <h2>Complaints or queries</h2>
            <p>
                We strive to meet the highest standards when collecting and
                using personal information. For this reason, we take any
                complaints we receive about this very seriously. We encourage
                people to bring it to our attention if they think that our
                collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or
                inappropriate. We would also welcome any suggestions for
                improving our procedures. This privacy notice was drafted with
                brevity and clarity in mind. It does not provide exhaustive
                detail of all aspects of our collection and use of personal
                information. However, we are happy to provide any additional
                information or explanation needed. Any requests or complaints on
                how we handle personal data should be sent to
                cheltenham@freedomchurch.cc.

            <h2>Access to personal information</h2>
            <p>
                We try to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people
                access to their personal information. Individuals can find out
                if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access
                request’ under the GDPR. If we do hold information about you we
                will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>give you a description of it;</li>
                <li>tell you why we are holding it;</li>
                <li>tell you who it could be disclosed to; and</li>
                <li>
                    let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible
                    form.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To make a request to Freedom Church Cheltenham for any personal
                information we may hold, you need to put the request in writing
                to cheltenham@freedomchurch.cc.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally,
                for example by providing you with the specific information you
                need over the telephone or by email.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct
                any mistakes by, once again, contacting us by email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the GDPR you also have the right to erasure, this means
                that if you would like us to delete any or all of the data we
                hold about you we are happy to do so. Simply put in your request
                to us by email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we can fulfil any of the requests outlined in this
                section, we will need you provide sufficient evidence of your
                identity. Full instructions will be provided upon request.
