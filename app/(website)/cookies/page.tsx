            <p>
                Cookies are small text files that get placed on your computer
                by websites that you visit. Nearly every website uses cookies in
                order to make their websites work correctly or more efficiently.
                They are also used to provide information to the owners of the
                site.

            <p>
                Our cookie policy is very simple. We do not use cookies of any
                sort on our website, this means we don’t collect or use any
                personal data directly on our website (freeomcheltenham.church).
                That’s why our website doesn’t have a cookie consent popup when
                you first access our website. If this changes in the future we
                will let you know here.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy is subject to change and we recommend that you check
                back periodically to ensure that you are up to date with how we
                use your data.
